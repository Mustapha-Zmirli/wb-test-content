        <h2>Immersive Storytelling</h2>
        <p>
          Virtual and augmented reality are enabling immersive news and storytelling experiences, 
          transforming reader engagement beyond traditional text and images.
        </p>

        <h2>Micro-Payments for Articles</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of full subscriptions, micro-payment systems let readers pay for individual 
          articles, providing more flexibility for audiences and new revenue streams for publishers.
        </p>

        <h2>Data-Driven Editorial Decisions</h2>
        <p>
          Advanced analytics and AI tools are giving editors real-time insights into reader behavior, 
          allowing more precise targeting of topics and formats.
