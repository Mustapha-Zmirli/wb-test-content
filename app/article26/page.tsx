          Blockchain technology is transforming how publishers protect and authenticate
          their digital content, providing greater transparency and security.
        </p>

        <h2>Immutable Content Records</h2>
        <p>
          Every piece of content can be timestamped and stored on the blockchain,
          creating proof of authorship that cannot be altered or forged.
        </p>

        <h2>Smart Contracts for Licensing</h2>
        <p>
          Automated agreements make it easier to manage usage rights, royalties,
          and content distribution without relying on intermediaries.
        </p>

        <h2>Trust and Transparency</h2>
        <p>
          Readers and publishers benefit from increased trust, knowing that
          ownership and authenticity can always be verified publicly.
