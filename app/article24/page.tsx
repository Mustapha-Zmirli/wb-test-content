        <p>
          Subscription fatigue is real, and publishers are rethinking their models to
          balance profitability with reader accessibility.
        </p>

        <h2>Hybrid Subscription Models</h2>
        <p>
          Many publishers are combining free content with premium paid tiers,
          allowing flexibility while still monetizing exclusive content.
        </p>

        <h2>Bundles and Partnerships</h2>
        <p>
          Collaborations between media outlets are creating bundle subscriptions that
          give readers more value for their money.
        </p>

        <h2>Impact on Independent Publishers</h2>
        <p>
          Smaller publishers are experimenting with niche-focused subscriptions
          and community-driven memberships to sustain growth.
