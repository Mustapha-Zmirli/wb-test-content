          As audiences seek more personalized content, niche subscription platforms are 
          emerging as a sustainable model for independent publishers and creators.
        </p>

        <h2>Community-Driven Growth</h2>
        <p>
          Small but loyal audiences are more likely to support subscription-based platforms 
          that focus on specialized topics or local reporting.
        </p>

        <h2>Diversified Revenue Streams</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond subscriptions, these platforms offer premium newsletters, exclusive 
          webinars, and merchandise to increase engagement.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges in Scaling</h2>
        <p>
          Niche platforms must balance growth with maintaining authenticity, ensuring they 
          don't alienate their core audience.
