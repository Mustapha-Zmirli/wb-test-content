          Artificial Intelligence is increasingly playing a role in digital publishing,
          from automated news reports to personalized content recommendations.
        </p>

        <h2>Automated Content Creation</h2>
        <p>
          Newsrooms are leveraging AI tools to generate quick reports on topics like finance,
          sports, and weather, freeing up journalists for in-depth analysis.

        <h2>Personalized Reader Experiences</h2>
        <p>
          Machine learning algorithms help match readers with stories that align with their
          interests, increasing engagement and retention.
        </p>

        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          While AI offers efficiency, concerns remain around bias, accuracy, and the potential
          replacement of human creativity.
