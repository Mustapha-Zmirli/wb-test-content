          Decentralized news platforms are emerging as a disruptive force in the media industry, 
          giving journalists direct control over their work and enabling transparent revenue models. 
          By leveraging blockchain technology, these platforms bypass traditional gatekeepers.

        <h2>Direct-to-Audience Publishing</h2>
        <p>
          Journalists can now publish stories directly to their audiences without relying on centralized 
          editorial boards or corporate-owned outlets. This creates opportunities for niche coverage 
          and independent investigations.
        </p>

        <h2>Immutable Content Records</h2>
        <p>
          Blockchain ensures that once content is published, its origin and integrity can be verified. 
          This helps protect against misinformation and unauthorized edits.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges Ahead</h2>
        <p>
          Despite the promise, decentralized news faces hurdles such as scalability, monetization, 
          and ensuring editorial standards. Adoption will depend on balancing freedom with 
          accountability.
