          Decentralized verification systems represent the next evolution in content authentication. 
          Unlike traditional centralized authorities, these systems distribute verification across 
          multiple independent nodes, creating more resilient and trustworthy validation networks.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Network Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Decentralized systems operate through consensus mechanisms where multiple validators 
          must agree on content authenticity. This approach eliminates single points of failure 
          and reduces the risk of manipulation by any single authority.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Consensus Mechanisms</h2>
        <p>
          Different consensus algorithms serve various verification needs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Proof of Authority for trusted publisher networks</li>
          <li>Proof of Stake for economic incentive alignment</li>
          <li>Proof of Work for maximum security assurance</li>
          <li>Hybrid approaches for balanced performance and security</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Real-World Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          Several major content platforms are already experimenting with decentralized 
          verification. Early results show significant improvements in content authenticity 
          detection and reduced false positive rates compared to centralized systems.
