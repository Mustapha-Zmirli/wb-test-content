        <p>
          The digital publishing landscape faces unprecedented threats from sophisticated actors 
          seeking to monetize stolen content. Publishers must navigate complex challenges involving 
          AI-powered scraping tools, international copyright variations, and rapidly evolving 
          distribution networks.
        </p>
        
        <h2>AI-Powered Content Theft</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence has revolutionized content theft operations. Advanced bots can 
          now rewrite articles while preserving core meaning, making detection increasingly difficult. 
          These tools operate at scale, targeting thousands of publishers simultaneously across 
          global markets.
        </p>
        
        <h2>International Enforcement Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Cross-border content theft presents complex legal challenges. Different copyright laws, 
          varying enforcement mechanisms, and jurisdictional limitations create safe havens for 
          content thieves operating internationally.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Response Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          Publishers are developing multi-layered defense strategies including watermarking 
          technologies, blockchain verification, and collaborative enforcement networks. Success 
          requires combining technological innovation with industry cooperation and legal reform.
