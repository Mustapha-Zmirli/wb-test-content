          Artificial intelligence is becoming a critical tool for investigative journalists, 
          enabling faster data analysis, fact-checking, and source validation.
        </p>

        <h2>Automated Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          AI systems can process millions of documents, financial records, and leaked datasets 
          in seconds, uncovering patterns human reporters might miss.
        </p>

        <h2>Enhanced Fact-Checking</h2>
        <p>
          Machine learning models can cross-reference statements against public records and 
          trusted databases to detect inaccuracies instantly.
        </p>

        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          While AI offers efficiency, journalists must ensure algorithms are transparent and 
          free from bias to maintain credibility and public trust.
