        <p>
          The rollout of 5G technology is transforming mobile connectivity, enabling faster speeds, 
          lower latency, and new possibilities for mobile applications and services.
        </p>

        <h2>Enhanced Mobile Broadband</h2>
        <p>
          5G networks provide significantly faster download and upload speeds compared to 4G LTE, 
          enabling seamless streaming of high-quality video, quicker file transfers, and smoother 
          browsing experiences even in crowded areas.
        </p>

        <h2>Low Latency Applications</h2>
        <p>
          With latency reduced to milliseconds, 5G enables real-time applications like cloud gaming, 
          augmented reality experiences, and remote control of devices that were previously impractical 
          on mobile networks.
        </p>

        <h2>Internet of Things Connectivity</h2>
        <p>
          5Gs ability to connect a massive number of devices simultaneously supports the growth of 
          smart cities, connected vehicles, and industrial automation, creating new ecosystems of 
          connected devices and services.
