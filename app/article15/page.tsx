        <p>
          AI-generated content is challenging the boundaries of intellectual property law, 
          creating urgency for stronger protections for human-created works. Artists and writers 
          must adapt to safeguard their creative output.

        <h2>Automated Imitation</h2>
        <p>
          AI tools can mimic writing styles, visual aesthetics, and even voices, blurring the 
          distinction between original and derivative works. This puts traditional copyright 
          enforcement to the test.
        </p>

        <h2>Digital Watermarking</h2>
        <p>
          Invisible digital watermarks embedded in content are becoming a popular defense, 
          allowing creators to trace unauthorized usage and prove ownership.
        </p>

        <h2>Collaborative Regulation</h2>
        <p>
          Policymakers, tech companies, and creative communities are beginning to collaborate 
          on frameworks to regulate AI use in content creation while preserving innovation.
