        <p>
          As digital products consume increasing amounts of energy, sustainable web design has emerged 
          as an important approach to reducing the environmental impact of our online activities.
        </p>

        <h2>Efficient Coding Practices</h2>
        <p>
          Clean, minimal code reduces file sizes and processing requirements, leading to lower energy 
          consumption. This includes optimizing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript, and removing 
          unnecessary dependencies.
        </p>

        <h2>Green Hosting Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          Choosing web hosting providers that use renewable energy sources significantly reduces the 
          carbon footprint of websites. Many providers now offer carbon-neutral hosting options powered 
          by solar, wind, or other renewable energy.
        </p>

        <h2>User Experience Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          Designing intuitive interfaces that help users find what they need quickly reduces the time 
          spent interacting with a website, which in turn decreases energy usage across millions of 
          devices.
